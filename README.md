# CS8395_ProjectOne_ARBookCover

## Introduction
This AR bookcover program is for a illustrated children's book called One Leaf Rides the Wind. Both the front and back cover of the book can be interacted in AR form. This AR book cover involves the augmented text, the augmented effect according to the picure on cover, and the supplement augmented models to show scenes in book. The AR form book can significantly arouse kids' interests and make them get into the book actively. 

## Platform
Unity 2018.4.14f1
Vuforia Engine 8.6
Android 8.0.0

## Interaction
*The front cover*
There are augmented text of the title and author. The virtual butterflies fly out of the lotus accompanied by bright light. There is a cherry blossom flower(AR button) on the bottom left which can be interacted with, when your hand cover that flower area, to generate rain of flowers in front of the bookcover (toggle the butterfly particle system and the flower particle system).
*The back cover*
There are a short piece of book review and the publication information on the back cover displayed in augmented reality, which can be toggled by buttons on the phone screen. Also, there is a Virtual Button in leaf shape that make the scene described in the book review appear.

## Limitation
The image of the back cover has only been rated as one star (total 5 stars), which means it is not that suitable for augmented reality, so the interaction is not that sensitive especially when users keep slightly moving the cover inevitably or hold the book with some angles or positions.

## How to run the code
Download AR_BookCover file and install AR_BookCover.apk on an Android phone(Android 8.0.0). Then run the app by referencing the interaction description.
